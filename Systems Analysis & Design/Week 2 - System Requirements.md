# Investigating System Requirements

### Introduction to System Requirements

- System requirements encompass all activities the new system must perform and the constraints it must meet.
- Understanding system requirements is crucial for successful project outcomes, as they guide the design and implementation phases.
- The process begins with identifying stakeholders and gathering their needs through various techniques.

### Stakeholders and Their Importance

- Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have an interest in the project, including users, management, and IT staff.
- Their input is vital for identifying requirements and ensuring the system meets business needs.
- Engaging stakeholders early helps in gathering comprehensive requirements and reduces the risk of project failure.

### Information-Gathering Techniques

- Techniques include interviews, questionnaires, document analysis, and direct observation of business processes.
- Each technique has its strengths; for example, interviews provide in-depth insights, while questionnaires can gather data from a larger audience.
- Combining multiple techniques often yields the best results in understanding user needs.

### Models and Modeling in Requirements Analysis

- Modeling involves creating abstract representations of the system to visualize requirements and processes.
- Common modeling techniques include use case diagrams, flowcharts, and entity-relationship diagrams.
- Models help in communicating requirements to stakeholders and serve as a reference throughout the project.

# The Larger Ridgeline Mountain Outfitters (RMO) Project

### Overview of RMO's Existing Systems

- RMO operates several information systems that support its operations, including Supply Chain Management (SCM) and Customer Support Systems (CSS).
- Existing systems are outdated and do not integrate well, leading to inefficiencies in sales and marketing processes.
- The need for a new Consolidated Sales and Marketing System (CSMS) arises from competitive pressures and technological advancements.

### Proposed Consolidated Sales and Marketing System (CSMS)

- The CSMS will integrate various sales channels (online, phone, retail) into a single system.
- It will consist of four subsystems: Sales, Order Fulfillment, Customer Account, and Marketing.
- This approach aims to enhance customer experience and streamline operations by providing a unified platform.

### Shortcomings of Existing Systems

- Current systems treat different sales channels as separate entities, leading to a fragmented customer experience.
- Outdated technology fails to support modern customer interaction methods, such as mobile and social media.
- Upgrading existing systems incrementally is not feasible; a complete overhaul is necessary.

# Systems Analysis Activities

### Key Activities in Systems Analysis

- Systems analysis involves gathering detailed information, defining and prioritizing requirements, and developing user-interface dialogs.
- Engaging users throughout the process ensures that the system aligns with their needs and expectations.
- Evaluating requirements with users helps adapt to changes and refine the system design.

### FURPS Framework for Requirements

- FURPS stands for Functional, Usability, Reliability, Performance, and Security requirements.
- Each category addresses different aspects of system performance and user experience, ensuring a comprehensive approach to requirements gathering.
- FURPS+ extends this framework by adding design constraints, implementation requirements, interface requirements, and physical requirements.

### Importance of Prioritizing Requirements

- Prioritizing requirements helps manage limited resources and avoid scope creep during project development.
- High-priority requirements are typically addressed in early project iterations to ensure critical functionalities are delivered first.
- This approach allows for iterative feedback and adjustments based on user input.

# System Requirements Overview
