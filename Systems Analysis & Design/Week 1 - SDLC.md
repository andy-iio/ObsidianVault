### Agile Development Methodologies

- Agile development emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to change during the development process.
- It allows for iterative progress through small, manageable increments, enabling teams to adapt to new requirements as they arise.
- Agile methodologies include frameworks like Scrum and Kanban, which facilitate collaboration and continuous improvement.

# Iterative Development and Its Importance

### What is Iterative Development?

- Iterative development is a process where the system is developed in small, repeatable cycles or iterations.
- Each iteration involves completing a portion of the system, refining it based on feedback, and adding more features in subsequent iterations.
- This approach helps in identifying issues early and allows for adjustments based on user feedback.

### Benefits of Iterative and Agile Approaches

- Reduces the risk of project failure by allowing for continuous testing and feedback.
- Encourages collaboration among stakeholders, leading to a better understanding of user needs.
- Facilitates faster delivery of functional components, providing value to users sooner.
