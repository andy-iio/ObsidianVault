# Key Terms/Concepts

- **Network Interface Card (NIC)**: A hardware component that connects a computer to a network, allowing it to communicate with other devices.
- **Throughput**: The amount of data transmitted over a network in a given time period, typically measured in bits per second.
- **Bandwidth**: The maximum rate of data transfer across a network path, defined as the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies that can be transmitted (range of frequencies). Also measured in bits per second. 
- **Attenuation**: The reduction in signal strength as it travels through a medium, which can lead to data loss.
- **Latency**: The time delay between the transmission of data and its receipt, which can affect network performance.

# Protocols

- **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)**: A network protocol that listens for a carrier signal before transmitting data and detects collisions to manage data transmission.
- **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**: A protocol used to map an IP address to a MAC address, allowing devices to communicate over a network.

# Data Sending
- **Unicast**: A communication method where data is sent from one sender to one specific receiver.
- **Multicast**: A method of sending data to a group of devices on a network.
- **Broadcast**: A method of sending data to all devices on a network segment.
# NIC's 

Each end device uses a network interface card (NIC). Most use ethernet standards for communication.
The NIC contains a transceiver that transmits and receives data signals over network media. 
NIC's belong to BOTH the physical and data link layer.
### Functions of NIC's

| Function                | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Framing**        | NICs issue data signals and assemble and disassemble data frames for transmission over the network.                              |
| **Physical Addressing** | NICs interpret MAC addresses to ensure data is sent to the correct device.                                                       |
| **Routines**            | NIC's perform routines that determine which node has the right to transmit data                                                  |
| **Traffic Management**  | NICs perform functions like network management, prioritization, buffering and traffic filtering to optimize network performance. |
### Characteristics of NIC's

NICs come in a variety of types depending on:  
- Connection type (for example, Ethernet or Wi-Fi)  
- Maximum network transmission speed (for example, 10Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10Gbps)  
- Connector interfaces (for example, RJ-45)  
- Number of connector interfaces, or ports  
- Support for enhanced features, buffering, or traffic management  
- Method of interfacing with the computer’s motherboard (Integrated, Expansion, Peripheral)


# Problem-Solving Steps

1. **Identify the Problem**: Determine what type of network issue you are facing (e.g., connectivity, speed).
2. **Gather Information**: Use commands like `ipconfig /all` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Linux/Mac) to gather network configuration details.
3. **Check Physical Connections**: Ensure all cables and devices are properly connected and powered on.
4. **Test Connectivity**: Use `ping` to test connectivity to other devices on the network.
5. **Analyze Network Traffic**: Use tools like Wireshark to analyze traffic and identify issues such as collisions or excessive noise.
6. **Check ARP Tables**: Ensure that MAC addresses are correctly mapped to IP addresses using ARP requests and replies.
7. **Implement Solutions**: Based on your findings, implement solutions such as reconfiguring devices, replacing faulty cables, or adjusting network settings.
