The performance of most algorithms will depend on the way the data is organized. 
[[Data Structures]] and algorithms go hand-in-hand.

When designing an algorithm, first go for *correctness* and worry about *efficiency* later. This gives you something to test against (your initial code) to see if your refactored code is better/faster etc. You may not need to add any efficiency at all if the initial code meets the standards. 
### Improving Performance
In order to improve the performance of a computer system, there are two options:
1. Use newer, faster hardware (Moore's law) --> not always practical, eg mars rover or robot
2. Use better algorithms-> better, possibly cheaper and quicker than hardware change

### Essential Info
In order to build an algorithm, you need to find what is essential.
- What are the required operations to achieve the essential goals
- How would you implement the algorithm (use the right mathematical framework)
- Redefine the operations using [[Set Theory |set theory]]
