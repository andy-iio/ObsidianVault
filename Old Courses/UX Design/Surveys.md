## What is a Survey? 

• Research method to collect data from a sample of individuals.  
• Used to collect insights into various topics, opinions, behaviors.  
• Widely used in various fields.

## The Importance of Survey Design
good survey design directly impact the quality of the data collected
respondents understand survey intent, more accurate responses
reliability == consistency between responses
more engaging and user friendly, users more willing to participate, minimize errors, reduce likelihood of incorrect data
poorly designed surveys == biases and unreliable results
[[#Writing Effective Questions]]

good survey design is critical for getting good data. 

• Accurate data collection  
• Validity and reliability  
• Relevance to research objectives  
• Minimization of bias
• Increased response rates  
• Cost-effectiveness  
• Ethical considerations  
• Improved data analysis
- Enhanced generalizability  
- Informed decision-making
## Types of Surveys

chose type of survey based off research objectives

• Cross-sectional surveys -> collect data from participants at a specific point in time
• Longitudinal surveys  -> collect data from same participants over long period of time
• Descriptive surveys  -> describe characteristics of population 
• Analytical surveys -> analyze relationship between other variables
• Explanatory surveys -> understand the reason behind patterns, casual relationships behind data
• Attitude surveys  
• Opinion surveys -> gauge public opinion on specific topics (politics)
• Health surveys -> collect info about health behaviors, access to health care
• Market research surveys -> conducted in the business sector, market trends, buying habits
• Employee surveys  -> workplace surveys, employee satisfaction, used to improve workplace conditions
• Customer satisfaction surveys  - measure customer satisfaction, identify areas for improvement
• Exit surveys -> when ppl leave a job, etc, learn reasons for departure

can also have a mix of these surveys depending on the questions in the survey

## Defining Clear Objectives

- Identify the purpose  -> what specific info are you trying to gain
- Specify research questions -> clear and concise and directly related to purpose
- Determine the scope -> target audience, geographic scope, time frame for data collection
- Feasibility  (budget, resources, time constraints)
- Prioritization  (if multiple objectives, prioritize them)
-  Measurable outcomes (specify the metrics used to analyze the data and how are they relevant to research outcomes)
- Stakeholder input  (what are their priorities, expectations)
- Relevance to decision-making 
- Refine and review (get feedback, refine to enhance survey quality)

## Defining Target Population

• Clarify survey objectives  -> goals of the survey
• Identify the scope -> demographics, characteristics, [[Personas]]
• Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
• Geographical boundaries  
• Time constraints -> target pop reflect ppl relevant during the time frame
• Accessibility 
• Subpopulations -> representation from diff subpopulations  
• Sampling -> make sure its representative of entire pop
• [[#Pre Testing|Pilot testing]] -> with small group, test to check if any problems
## Sampling Techniques

depends on resources, char of target audience

• Simple random sampling  -> every person has an equal chance of being picked
• Stratified random sampling  -> divide into subgroups based on certain char (age, gender, income) then select random samples from each group
• Systematic sampling  -> eg list of 1000, select every 10th person
• Cluster sampling -> select whole random groups
• Convenience sampling  -> select more convenient ppl and readily available ppl (might not be representative)
• Quota sampling  -> quotas for certain characteristics to ensure sample reflects population
• Purposive sampling  -> select individuals based on researcher judgement (when specific expertise requires)
• Snowball sampling -> participants introduce researchers to other potential participants
Multistage sampling  -> use multiple, first cluster than random
• Panel sampling -> selects from pre existing panel that has said they would participate (want to participate in a future survey?)

## Ethical Considerations
-  Informed consent  
- Voluntary participation -> right to withdraw at any time, no negative consequences
- Anonymity and confidentiality  
- Data security
- Ethical Considerations  
- Avoiding harm (no stressful questions that harm participants unless necessary)
- Benefit  
- Debriefing (if survey contains sensitive topics, provide additional support if needed)
- Fair treatment and no discrimination
- Ethics approvals (review boards might need to approve) 
- Transparent reporting (to help replicate survey if needed)
- Respecting cultural sensitivities  
- Honesty and integrity

## Types of Questions
types depends on needed info, and how the data will be used
• Open-ended questions  -> lots of qualitative data, but can be more challenging to analyze (ex. what are the main challenges you face in your job)
• Closed-ended questions  -> easier to analyze
• Likert scale questions  -> agree or disagree with a statement using a scale

• Multiple-choice questions
• Ranking questions  
• Matrix questions  
![[Pasted image 20240517174255.png]]

• Demographic questions (what is your ethnicity, age, gender, etc.)
• Binary questions (chose b/t two options eg yes or no / true or false)
• Picture or image-based questions (eg diff product designs, chose preferred design) 
• Behavioral intent questions (their likelihood to engage in a particular behavior in the future (how likely are you to recommend a product to a friend in the future))

## Writing Effective Questions

• Clearly define survey objectives  
• Use simple and clear language  
• Avoid ambiguity and vagueness  
• Ask one question at a time
• Use neutral and unbiased language  
• Avoid assumptions  
• Use close-ended and open-ended questions strategically
• Provide balanced response options  
• Order of questions  --> start easy, then move on to complex
• [[#Pre Testing|Pilot testing]] 
• Scale consistency
• Include a [[#Main Body / Mix of Questions|mix of questions]]  
• Be mindful of respondent burden -> not too long, no unnecessary complexity, 5-10mins
• Test for bias  
• Feedback -> use to improve future survey design

## Survey Structure

#### Introduction
brief intro, importance of respondents participation, any required info for participants, obtain participants consent and how data will be used 

#### Main Body / Mix of Questions

#### Conclusion
thank respondents, any follow up steps, contact information, space for respondents to leave contact info if follow up is required

## Pre Testing

• Pilot testing with a small sample  
• Identifying and addressing issues

## Data Collection

• Face-to-face -> allows for clarification, when a more personal touch is needed
• Telephone  
• Self-administered paper -> participants get printed questionnaire to complete
• Mail
• Online  
• Mobile   
• Mixed-mode  
• In-person intercepts -> researchers intercept ppl in public spaces to take survey (eg at the mall)
• Panel  
• Social media

## Timing and Frequency

• Consider the best time to administer a survey  
• Decide on a one-time or repeated approach

## Data Analysis

• Develop a coding system for responses  
• Accurate and consistent data entry  
• Identify and rectify errors  
• Address missing data

## Statistical Analysis

• Descriptive statistics  
• Inferential statistics (if applicable)

## Reporting Results

• Organize findings  
• Present results using charts, graphs, and narrative summaries
