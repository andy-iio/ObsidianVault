### Five Dimensions of Interaction Design
![[Pasted image 20240531170205.png]]
Words->buttons, labels, other text elements. use clear, familiar terminology, 
Time-> transitions, loading times, responsiveness. smooth well times interactions are better
Behavior->how ppl interact, their habits,
Visual Representations->icons, graphics, diagrams, typography
Physical Objects->any physical objects, how user engage, touch screen physical space
all work together

### Design Thinking
![[Pasted image 20240531171552.png]]
understand-> emphasize and define with users understand needs and pain points. user research, interview, gain insights of userbase
explore->think of ideas to work with understand phase, and prototype design
materialize-> test and implement final product
### Levels of Design
Structure: information architecture and interaction design
– Content  
– Navigation  
– Flow

wireframes, design maps, how will user move through app/website

### User Flows
Flow: diagrams that depict the path a user can take to complete a specific task while interacting with a product.  
– User’s needs  
– The most efficient way to meet those needs.  
– Understand the user journey, match goals with user expectations, identify user entry points, visualize user flow, refine the flow with feedback.  

### Interface
The appearance (look and feel), behaviour, interactivity.  
– Layout 
– Color schemes  
– Buttons  
– Icons  
– Typography

### Commands and Actions
contribute to overall usability and interactivity of product.
They represent the “verbs” in the interface.  (specific tasks/operations users preform with interface, swiping, scrolling, submit forms, select items from menu. focus on making these actions intuitive easy and simple for users)
commands(voice commands, keyboard shortcuts, menu driven commands(selecting save from a menu))
• Different methods for initiating actions or activating commands.  
• Making it clear that you can perform an action with affordances.  
• Patters and components that promote those actions.  
– Start, pause, cancel, or complete an action.  
– Enter a setting, configuration or value.  
– Manipulating an object or component with the interface.  
– Applying changes or transformations.  
– Removing or deleting something.  
– Adding or creating something.

### Patterns in UX Design
• Button groups  
• Hover tools  
• Action panels  
• Completion buttons  
• Smart menu items  
• Preview screens  
• Progress indicators  
• Cancel buttons

### Information Architecture
The process or organizing, structuring, and labeling content in a way  
that makes it easy for users to find and understand without any confusion
descriptive and clear labels, easy navigation paths.
• Organization and structure  
• Hierarchy  
• Navigation paths  -> how users move through app or design, links guide users to relevant content
• Labels and taxonomies  -> descriptive labels help users understand what happens when they click on a button
• User-centric approach  -> consider user needs & how users search for info 

### Navigation
Creating, analyzing, and implementing ways for users to navigate  
through a website or app.  
• Purpose of navigation  -> to guide users from one point to another within the product. (move between diff pages, features, products)

### Navigation Patterns
• Object-oriented navigation  -> effective for creative / exploration apps
• Task-oriented navigation  -> based around specific user tasks
• Workflow-based navigation  -> for products with a standardized process

• Tooltip pattern  -> msg/info about how to use feature, micro tutorials without disrupting workflow
• Spotlight pattern  ->Tutorial at beginning of using product, or when new features released
• Breadcrumbs  
• Hamburger menu  -> hides nav menu on mobile to save space
• Customization menu  -> user can tailor nav to their workflow, option to customize menu items
• Progressive disclosure menu  -> show essential elements up front and reveals other later(eg plus + symbol to see more info)
• Vertical menu
• Dropdown menu
• Fixed position menu (static at top even on scroll)
• Custom mega menu (hover over item to reveal menu info)
• Card grid (below)

### Improving Navigation

• Improve visibility  -> use familiar menu locations
• Write clear content  -> use tooltips if needed
• Add location indicators -> breadcrumbs, highlight current menu item, to let users know current location

### Layout
How particular elements in an interface are arranged. A good layout follows the principles of visual information hierarchy, visual flow, alignment trough a grid, and adheres to Gestalt principles.

### Gestalt Principles
Gestalt principles explains how our brains perceive visual information.  
They describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images when objects are perceived.
Principles:
**Emergence:** 
**Closure:** we mentally complete incomplete shapes / figures. even if parts are missing users see the whole
**Common Region:** when elements are located within the same close region/container our brains automatically group them together (eg several buttons close together, we think they are related)
**Continuity:** smooth continuous line over abrupt changes. eyes follow the lines and paths of the design and prefer a flow than separated objects.
**Proximity:** elements close together are perceived as related (without boundary or container that common region has)
**Multistability:** 
**Figure/Ground:**
**Invariance:**
**Pragnanz:**
**Similarity:**
**Symmetry:**
**Common Fate:**
