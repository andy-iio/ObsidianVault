### Challenges of Mobile Design
- Screen size-> make sure design is responsive for all screen sizes & devices (android, apple, etc)
- Touch elements -> make sure buttons are clickable
- Limited capabilities for mobile (typing text)
- Accessibility (environments)->designs can be used by all users, environments, visual impairments, disabilities
### Mobile Design Trends
- Chatbots -> great tool to help, think about how it will increase the engagement with the users before adding
- Passwordless login -> (login with Google/Facebook, fingerprint/face recognition)
- Flat Design -> emphasizing clarity, simplicity, functionality of applications. bold typography, clean lines, no shadows, simple shapes, minimal textures, load smoothly. Good for slow speed internet bc not much to load

- Minimalism ->simple, clear, functional, white spaces, limited colour palettes, crisp typography, highlighting content over visual noise, will help to adapt design to various screen sizes
- Neumorphism -> cohesive and consistent user interface

 - Asymmetrical Elements -> contrasting colours, varying shapes, need to balance the design elements and make sure enough ocntrast, propoer proportins,w hitespace as needed
 - Voice User Interfaces (VUI's) -> alexa, speech to text google, eliminates need for user to type with keyboard
 - User Generated design-> photos comments videos users create and share, more engaging personalized experiences, fosters a sense of community within the app, can understand what the users are looking for to be able to address/meet users needs
 - bottom nav ->  nav located at bottom of screen, easy access to frequently used features, effortless one handed access on mobile, use icons, not text.
 - Augmented Reality -> overlays digital content into real world
 - Dark Mode -> black/dark background, text light, reduce eye strain, enhances battery performance
 - Glassmorphism -> semi/fully transparent backgrounds with blurred glass effect, visual appeal of using glassmorphism-> adds depth, increases visual appeal

Other trends to consider:
• Vertical stack (layout)  ->make sure all relevant content is displayed
• Touch tools (videos)  -> eg videos, how can they easily be played in the app
• Infinite list (email)-> scroll down, see more content, make sure correct and relevant is displayed,
• Loading or progress indicators (actions)  -> make sure loading is shown so user knows what happened
• Views and data (maps)  
• Data drill down (large content)-> showing correct/relevant filters
• Interactions and inputs (dates, text, moving content) -> ensure no issues typing text due to screen size
• Navigation (user flows)  
• Notifications -> keep users informed

### User Journey
user journey == whole journey, user flow == specific task

scenario based sequence of steps user will sue to achieve a goal
describes users experience engaging with different features

### User Flows
user flow is focused on a specific individual task
can use low fidelity wireframes to show user flows
