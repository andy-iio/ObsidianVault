### HMI's
A user interface or dashboard that connects a person to a machine, system, or device.  
Mostly used in the context of an industrial process.
### Principles of HMI's
Intuitive, user friendly, efficient. Logical layout of data.
- Clarity: clear visual cues and logical organization.  
- Consistency: consistency in design elements, terminology, and layout.  
- Feedback: immediate feedback for user actions. (need confirmation input was received, or if action failed, display that)

### SCADA
Control system architecture used for efficiently managing and monitoring industrial processes.  
It’s commonly employed for both local and remote process management.

### Principles of Good Visual Design
• Visual hierarchy  
• Composition  
• Colour  
• Typography -> easy to read
• Readability  
• Evoking a feeling 
• Images -> how are you using images to support user interaction

### Visual Hierarchy
Organizes elements so users can easily understand and prioritize information on a page. Includes size, colour, contrast, typography, spacing.
eg. ppl start reading at top left corner
Order elements from most to least important

### Composition
• Structure -> create balanced layout with clear visual flow
• Spacing and proximity -> maintain focus of all elements 
• Structural elements  -> grids, whitespace
• Golden ratio -> proportions that are visually pleasing

### Colour
use colours consistently in your interface - 60% for primary (background), 30% (navigation), 10% (call to action, accents) 
• Palette: use colours that complement your design.  -> reflect mood
• Contrast: ensure readability by using contrasting colours.  -> text & background contrast 
• Psychology: understand how colours evoke emotions.  -> user associations with diff colours
• Hierarchy: use colour variations to guide attention. -> emphasize key elements

excessive use of colour = confusing/ unpleasing
status & alarms (danger) -> red
risk of danger -> yellow
mandatory actions -> blue
follow familiarity of other systems the users are used to

diff background colours to differentiate screens (grey for main, brown for settings, etc) so you know what screen it is quickly

### Typography & Readability
• Typefaces: importance on readability and consistency.  
• Hierarchy: organize text with different font weights.  
• Spacing: adjust the line spacing and letter spacing.  
• Alignment: align text consistently, not out of place 
• Font size: ensure text is legible across different devices and screen sizes. (mobile, desktop) 
• Contrast: high contrast between text and background.
optimal line length is 50-70 characters per line
spaces between different paragraphs 
### Other Design Considerations
• Colour-blindness  
• Use of images -> alt text for images
• Accessibility -> text size, screen readers, no limitations or barriers for anyone
