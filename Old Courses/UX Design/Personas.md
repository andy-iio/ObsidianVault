#UXDesign 

### What are Personas?
A persona is a fictional, yet realistic, description of a typical or target user of the product. Personas are archetypes representing our  
target customer.  
- Who will be using our application, product, solution, or service.  
- Who are we designing the UX for

Personas are a powerful tool used in UX, but is also used in marketing, design, product development, and others.

!*Don't confuse persona archetypes with stereotypes. Stereotypes  
usually are the result of designer or product team biases and assumptions, rather than factual data*!

• Personas are detailed representations of target users
• Personas influence feature prioritization
• Validation through ongoing testing
• Iterative user-centered design process
### Personas:
- Understanding users -> identify specific needs, preferences, and user goals
- Informed decision-making 
- Prioritization -> to prioritize features, functionality based on user expectation and what is most relevant to them
- Enhanced UX 
- Testing and validation -> ensure solution meets needs of intended users
- Communication and collaboration -> stakeholders, designers, all work towards unified vision of that product
- Marketing and positioning 
- Adaptation to user feedback -> does the feedback you get from the users align with the personas?

### Research and Observation
- Systematic process that integrates research and observation to develop detailed representation of target users.  
- An iterative process, requiring regular refinement and updates as products evolve or new data becomes available.  

### Creating Personas

Personas are derived from qualitative research  
	*Especially the behavioral patterns observed during interviews with and observations of a product's users and potential users (and sometimes customers)*  
	*Gaps in this data are filled by supplemental research and data*
	
Creating believable and useful personas requires an equal measure of detailed analysis and creative synthesis  
	*A standardized process aids both activities significantly*
	
Ensure you have as much information as you can about your users. Get this info through different methods such as:  
	– Surveys  
	– Interviews  
	– Usability Tests  
	– Marking information  
	– Sales information
	
- Define objectives  
- Conduct user research -> interviews, surveys, etc. to collect info about users preferences, needs, and pain points
- Identify patterns and trends  
- Segment your audience  -> group users into segments based on shared characteristics/ behaviors 
- Create detailed personas  -> for each user segment, include demographics, job roles, etc. give personas a name and a face to make it more believable
- Include real quotes and stories from participants and actual users
- Prioritize information  -> details that will guide design decisions
- Validate personas  -> seek feedback from additional user research/ stakeholders, etc. to ensure the personas accurately reflect the user base
- Create persona documents  -> to make them easily accesible
- Integrate personas into design  -> make sure product design aligns with persona data
- Iterate and update  -> update as new data is collected or as the user base evolves
- Share with the team

### Types of Personas

• Primary personas  
• Secondary personas  -> ensure more comprehensive understanding
• Negative personas  -> users who are not the target audience, or may have a negative impact on the project
• Persona spectrums  -> instead of distinct personas, can create a spectrum of people with diff needs/behaviors
• Proto-personas  -> created before user research
• Role-based personas 
• Goal-oriented personas 
• Demographic personas -> based on age, gender, income, education
• Behavioral personas  -> usage patterns of users (preferences/habits)
• Novice vs. expert personas -> new to a product vs experienced

### Why Personas Fail
- Personas were created but not used 
- There’s no buy-in from leadership 
- Personas were created in a silo
- Communication failure -> involve all departments so they understand why using personas is important and helpful

### Pros and Cons of Personas
