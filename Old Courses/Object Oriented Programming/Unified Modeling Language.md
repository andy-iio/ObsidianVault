The Unified Modeling Language is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.[1]  
It consists of an integrated set of diagrams, developed to help software developers for visualizing, constructing a software system.  
The UML uses mostly graphical notations to express the design of software projects.

##### Structure Diagrams: 
Structure diagrams represents the static aspects of the system. It emphasize the things that must be present in the system being modeled

##### Behavior Diagrams:
Behavior diagrams represent the dynamic aspect of the system. It emphasize what must happen in the system being modeled

Class diagrams are the main building block in object-oriented modeling. It is a type of structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships among objects.

Classes in class diagrams are represented by boxes that are partitioned into three:
