# Security
#### Overview  
An O/S associates a set of privileges with each process.  
• These privileges dictate what resources various processes may access, including regions of memory, files, and privileged system instructions.  
The highest level of privilege is referred to as administrator,  super user, or root.  
• Processes having this level of privilege have full access to all  the functions and services of the operating system.  
A key security issue in the design of any O/S is to prevent, or at least detect, attempts to circumvent these controls.
The enemies:
• Intruders
• AKA hacker, cracker, etc.
• Masquerader: An individual who is not authorized to use the computer and who penetrates a system’s access controls to exploit a legitimate user’s account
• Misfeasor: A legitimate user who accesses data, programs, or resources for which such access is not authorized, or who is authorized for such access but misuses privileges
• Clandestine user: An individual who seizes supervisory control of the system and uses this control to evade auditing and access controls or to suppress audit collection
The masquerader is likely to be an outsider; the misfeasor generally is an insider; and the clandestine user can be either an outsider or an insider
•Malicious Programs:  viruses, spyware, ransomware, etc.
Perhaps the most sophisticated types of threats to computer systems are presented by programs that exploit vulnerabilities in computing systems.
Such threats are referred to as malicious software, or malware.
In this context, we are concerned with threats to application programs as well as utility programs, such as editors and compilers, and kernel-level programs.
Malicious software can be divided into two categories:
•Malware that need a host program, (aka parasitic) are essentially fragments of programs that cannot exist independently of some actual application program,   utility, or system program.
•Independent malware are self-contained programs that can be scheduled and run by the operating system.
We can also differentiate between those software threats that do not replicate and those that do.
